The Monotonic Upstream Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) was used for the tracer advection and
the Energy and Enstrophy conservative (EEN) scheme was used for the momentum advection (Arakawa
and Lamb 1981; Barnier et al. 2006). No-slip conditions on closed lateral boundaries were applied and the
bottom friction was param- eterised by a quadratic function.
